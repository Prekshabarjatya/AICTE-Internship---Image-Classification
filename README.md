# AICTE-Internship--Image-Classification

## Overview
Implementing a machine learning model to classify images into predefined categories using CNNs.

## Problem Statement
Manual image classification is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project aims to automate and improve accuracy and efficiency.

## Proposed Solution
1. **Dataset Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather and preprocess labeled images.
2. **Model Selection and Training**: Choose and train a CNN model.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assess performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the model for practical use and monitor its performance.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Processor**: Multi-core CPU (Intel i5 or i7)
- **Memory (RAM)**: At least 8 GB, preferably 16 GB
- **Storage**: SSD with at least 256 GB
- **External GPU (optional)**: For enhanced performance
- **Cooling System**: Effective cooling for intensive computations
- **External Storage**: For backups and large datasets

## Software Requirements
- **Frontend**: Streamlit Web Config
- **Backend**: Streamlit API, Python
- **Model**: CNN
- **Framework**: Sklearn, TensorFlow
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud
